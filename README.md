# A-Z File Organizer

Drag-and-drop (or right-click) any folder → every **file** inside is moved/copied into neat A-Z sub-folders.  
Empty folders or non-letter files land in `#`.

## Quick start

1. Download [latest release](https://github.com/elaichix/a-z-file-organizer/releases) or clone the repo.
2. Open terminal / CMD in the folder you want to organise.
3. Run:

```bash
python az_organise.py          # dry-run preview
python az_organise.py --go     # actually move files
